# Road-Accident-Dashboard-EXCEL

The Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 provides valuable insights into road accidents and their impact. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to help stakeholders understand the data effectively. The requirements addressed are as follows:

1. Primary KPI: Total casualties after accidents.
2. Primary KPIs: Total casualties and their percentage in relation to accident severity, as well as the maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
3. Secondary KPIs: Total casualties based on the type of vehicle involved.
4. Monthly trend: Comparison of casualties between the current year and the previous year on a monthly basis.
5. Maximum casualties by road type.
6. Distribution of casualties by road surface conditions.
7. Relationship between casualties and the time of day (day/night) and location/area.

# Stakeholders:

The dashboard is beneficial to the following stakeholders:

Ministry of Transport.
Road Transport Department.
Police Force.

Process Used:

# The creation of the dashboard involved the following steps:

## Data Cleaning:

Inconsistencies and typos were checked using filters.
Typo error "Fetal" was replaced with "Fatal" using find and replace. A total of 49 replacements were made.
Additional columns were added for month and year using appropriate formulas.
Blanks were removed from specific columns.

## Data Processing:

Pivot tables were used for data aggregation and summarization.
Primary KPI: Total casualties were calculated by summing the number of casualties.
Primary KPIs: Total casualties for each accident severity were calculated. Percentages were derived by dividing relevant categories and converting to percentages.
Secondary KPIs: Total casualties for each vehicle type were calculated and visualized through a bar chart.
Monthly trend: A comparison of casualties between years was created using a combo chart.
Maximum casualties by road type: A bar chart was used to display the data.
Distribution of casualties by road surface: A tree-map visualization was utilized.
Relationship between casualties and location/day-night: Doughnut charts were employed to represent the data.

## Filter Panel:

A timeline was inserted to dynamically filter the data based on the accident date.
Slicers were added for urban and rural areas to provide interactive filtering options.

By following these steps, the road accident dashboard was created, offering a clear and insightful representation of the data. It enables stakeholders to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions to improve road safety.
